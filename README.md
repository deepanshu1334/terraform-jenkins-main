# terraform-jenkins

A real-time DevOps project involves using Terraform for infrastructure management, Jenkins for CI/CD automation, and AWS for cloud services. The project automates the deployment of a REST API on AWS, creating scalable resources like EC2 instances, VPCs, and RDS databases. Jenkins pipelines are configured to handle automated testing and deployments. Terraform modules ensure that the infrastructure is consistently provisioned, managed, and maintained across environments.
